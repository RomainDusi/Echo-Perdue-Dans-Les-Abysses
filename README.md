# Echo-Perdue-Dans-Les-Abysses

Be sure to have :
- Python 3.X interpreter
- Pygame

The main file to lauch the game is "Echo.py".

It's a really small and simple game but have fun or at least if it can help someone understanding how to do a labyrinth game.
( Even if it's an old one and i would need to modify a lot of things because the code is really ugly / too big ).
