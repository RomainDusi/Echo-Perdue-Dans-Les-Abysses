# Echo-Perdue-Dans-Les-Abysses

## What is this project ?

Echo Perdue Dans Les Abysses is a python game developped as my computer science project during last year of High School.  
It is a labyrinth game in which you play Echo, a little girl trapped in a cave.  
You will have to find your way out by searching for the "hidden" key pieces.

It's a really small and simple game but it could occupy you for a few minutes or could help someone understand how a labyrinth game works.
